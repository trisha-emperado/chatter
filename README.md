# Chatter

A group project with 3 other developers from my cohort at Dev Academy. 

Chatter is a social media app where the user can sign-in, create/edit their own profile, post public notes with commenting and like feature, and follow other users. 
The idea came about as our cohort was graduating, it could be way for us graduates to keep in touch with others.
